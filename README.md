## Introduction

**LinkedListsCPP** project features a collection of linked list data structures. These linked lists are fully templated and mirror the syntax and functionality of the C++ standard library containers. Currently only the linear linked list is implemented, but stay tuned for doubly and circular linked list releases!

## Getting Started

- Download the latest [release here](https://github.com/AlexanderJDupree/LinkedListsCPP/releases).

### Prerequisites
- linked_list.hpp utilizes C++ 11 language features and will **NOT** compile in older C++ language standards. In the future, compiler and language standard detection will be added for compatibility. If you want to work on this feature, feel free to contribute!

### Usage

All releases are header only, so just drop the .hpp file into your includes and start using the linked list like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "linear_linked_list.hpp"

int main()
{
    linear_linked_list<char> list { 'H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '!', '\n' };

    for(const char& letter : list)
    {
        std::cout << letter;
    }

    // Prints "HELLO!" to the console
    
    return 0;
}
```
Extensive documentation can be expected for the future. For right now, however, please the read header comments or examine how the linked lists are used in the unit tests for usage instructions.

## Execute Unit Tests

For those who wish to contribute, you'll need to build and run the unit tests. This repo utilizes [Premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) to build the necessary project files. After you Premake5 is installed you can start building the project.

- First, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderJDupree/LinkedListsCPP.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd LinkedListsCPP
```

- And run premake5 <action> to generate the project files for your platform. For example to build GNU Makefiles run:
```bash
premake5 gmake
```
- To run the unit tests, just build the application.

```
cd gmake && make
```

- If you need to rerun the tests, they are located in bin/tests/

## Built With

* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) - Unit Testing framework used
* [Premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) - Build System
